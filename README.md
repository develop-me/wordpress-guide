# Getting Started with WordPress

We used to teach WordPress on the bootcamp but removed it as not many of our hiring partners were using it anymore. However, it's a great way to get started as a freelance web-developer â€“ in fact, most of our instructors have been WordPress devs at some point in their career!

The WordPress community is absolutely amazing. There are usually tons of free events and conferences you can attend, which might sound a bit naff, but they are truly some of the most welcoming places I have been as a coder. There is a thriving community in Bristol and London.
